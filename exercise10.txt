Yes, they both can be hashes. You can create a hash using the other method as noted in exercise 6, which is list/array based  

When performing a hash.sort, the values are return in nested lists. You also can have k/v pairs inside of a list and access them via indices as 
you would in a normal list query. 

The main difference is how you access the key values. An array has to be accessed via the index #, and the hash can be accessed as an object


Example 
normal hash - {k:"key, v:"value"}
nested array hash [[k, value], [k, value]]
