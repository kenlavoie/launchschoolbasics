My first glance at the problem was that they would not be true. 

I read a few things online and stack overflow, and tried to understand more on hashing  from a couple 
developers at work. 

Based on everything replied back on, hashes do not care about order. as an example, if we collect environment variables, 
and one computer has a var set to be DOG="dog", CAT="cat", and the other is in inverse order, the hash is still the same
