Ruby Frameworks 

Rails would be my #1 choice. A couple of main reasons - one being the adoption of rails seems to be much higher than Sinatra or Padrino. 

(after reading more, Sinatra seems to be hugely popular with larger companies. Airbnb, heroku, and github to name a few)

From my limited understanding of rails, it's also one of the Frameworks that doesn't use a ruby DSL. I like the idea of learning core Ruby vs 
being knowledge bound to a particular framework. 

The dsl is super powerful, and from what it seems, ruby can excel at creating dsl due to not being as complex. 

But if I think of Vagrant or Puppet as examples, while they're great tools, you typically do not interact with them as you would a normal .rb file
